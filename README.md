# mental-health-based-tweet-classifier
Classifying depression-related tweets using a fine-tuned DistilBERT model with evaluation and visualization.

This project uses machine learning (using a DistilBERT model) to detect signs of depression in tweets. I trained the model on 20,000 labeled tweets to classify whether a tweet reflects depressive thoughts or not. The goal is to help identify mental health issues from social media posts using text data.

The model had a test accuracy of 77.98% along with an F1 score of 0.779, precision of 0.782, and recall of 0.779. It performed well on both depressed and non-depressed tweets. On the test set, the confusion matrix showed the model correctly classified 1,455 non-depressed and 1,664 depressed tweets.
